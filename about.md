A programming journeyman

### More Information

As a Full Stack software developer, I enjoy designing, building, verifying, maintaining and troubleshooting systems at scale. As a proponent of Agile Methods for developing enterprise software, I am constantly looking for ways to reduce the time it takes to ship software that is engineered to be reliable and as such I enjoy working in environments with fast feedback cycles.

As a practitioner of the craft of programming, I enjoy studying the properties of programs that are reliable and seek to express them in formal ways to replicate them in all of my programs. I also study the properties of programs that make them complicated and brittle to refrain from applying them in the programs that I write.

As a student of the science of software engineering, I am constantly on the look out for techniques that help reduce the complexity in analyzing software systems. Great techniques I believe invariably leads to great products.
